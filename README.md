## üî• News

* **`2025.03.05`** We've released the [code](./multitask/) for CARP on the multi-task benchmark (image-based). Stay tuned for the upcoming release of the single-task code for both state and image-based tasks.
* **`2024.12.09`** CARP has been released on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06782), along with a dedicated [homepage](https://carp-robot.github.io/) where you can explore its performance and architecture directly.


## üßæ TBD

- [x] Release paper on arXiv
- [x] Release code based on <a href='./multitask/'>multi-task</a>
- [ ] Release code based on <a href='./singletask/'>single-task</a> which includes both state and image-based tasks


## üëÄ Overview

<p align="center"> <img src="asset/framework.png" width="1000" align="center"> </p>

> **TL;DR**: introduce **C**oarse-to-**F**ine **A**uto**R**egressive Policy (**CARP**), a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy learning that redefines the autoregressive action generation process as a **coarse-to-fine**, next-scale approach. 

<p align="center"> <img src="asset/comparison.png" width="1000" align="center"> </p>

> The left panel shows the final predicted trajectories for each task, with CARP producing smoother and more consistent paths than Diffusion Policy (DP). 
The right panel visualizes intermediate trajectories during the refinement process for CARP (top-right) and DP (bottom-right). 
DP displays considerable redundancy, resulting in slower processing and unstable training, as illustrated by 6 selected steps among 100 denoising steps. 
In contrast, CARP achieves efficient trajectory refinement across all 4 scales, with each step contributing meaningful updates.


## üíª Code

Here, we provide two categories of code mentioned in the paper: `Multi-Task` for the Image-Based MimicGen Benchmark, following the same settings as SDP.
`Single-Task` for both Robomimic and Kitchen tasks, aligned with DP.
Just a heads-up: we've neatly centralized parameter management in `arg_util.py`. 
Before diving into any changes, take a look at this file‚Äîit'll make life a lot easier!

* [Single-Task](./singletask/)
